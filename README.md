# job-finder

I developed a job finder website using React and Tailwind, featuring a range of functionalities including a job listings page, user authentication (login, registration, and password reset), and a dashboard for managing and updating job data. This project required me to utilize my skills in front-end web development and design to create a secure and functional website for job seekers.
